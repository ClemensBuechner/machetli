Tutorial
========

Below, you see an example application of the minimizer on a Slurm computing grid. The script is excessively commented to provide insight into as many details as possible. If have the two required environment variables set (``PYTHON_3_7`` and ``DOWNWARD_REPO`` (at commit 09ccef5fd)), you can execute the script (on a Slurm computing node) and see the minimizer in action.

For an example on your local machine, check out the script below.
