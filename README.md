# Minimizer
The **Minimizer** is a Python package for reproducing characteristics of a program (such as bugs) with altered instances. It is meant to be helpful for debugging complex programs and narrowing down where specific behaviors originate.  
Originally, the Minimizer was developed to be used with the [Fast Downward](http://www.fast-downward.org) planning system, which is why it is equipped with the subpackage **planning**, which contains a collection of modules for more convenient use with solvers.
